# DrugAge Explorer: Longevity Compound Analysis Pipeline

![Project Overview](path_to_overview_image.png)

## Project Overview

DrugAge Explorer is a comprehensive data engineering project that processes and visualizes data from the DrugAge database, focusing on compounds that affect lifespan in model organisms. This project demonstrates a full-stack data pipeline, from web scraping to data visualization.

### Key Features

- üï∑Ô∏è Web Scraping: Extracts data from genomics.senescence.info
- üóÉÔ∏è Data Storage: Utilizes DuckDB for efficient data handling
- üßπ Data Transformation: Employs dbt for data cleaning and modeling
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Integration: Loads data into Google BigQuery
- üìä Data Visualization: Presents insights through a Streamlit app
- üê≥ Containerization: Dockerized for easy deployment
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Hosting: Deployed on Azure App Service

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](path_to_architecture_diagram.png)

1. **Data Extraction**: Python scripts with Selenium scrape the DrugAge database.
2. **Local Storage**: Raw data is stored in DuckDB for initial processing.
3. **Data Transformation**: dbt models clean and transform the data.
4. **Cloud Storage**: Processed data is loaded into Google BigQuery.
5. **Visualization**: A Streamlit app queries BigQuery and presents interactive visualizations.
6. **Deployment**: The app is containerized with Docker and hosted on Azure App Service.
